# 😊 Smile Detector using OpenCV and Face Detection

An interactive computer vision project that detects faces and smiles in real-time via webcam using Python and OpenCV. When both a face and a smile are detected, the system automatically captures a selfie 📸.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use **OpenCV**'s powerful image processing capabilities to:
- Detect faces using Haarcascade classifiers
- Recognize smiles within detected face regions
- Capture and save selfies when both a face and a smile are detected

---

## 🎯 Objective

To showcase real-time **face and smile detection** using computer vision algorithms and trigger actions (like saving a selfie) based on specific facial feature detection.

---

## 🧠 Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV Library: `pip install opencv-python`
- Haarcascade XML files:
  - `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`
  - `haarcascade_smile.xml`

These XML files must be present in your project directory.
